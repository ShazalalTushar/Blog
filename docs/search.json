    "text": "In this blog, I will cover random variable, types of random variable, probability density function (PDF), cumulative density function (CDF), relation between PDF and CDF. At the end, I will also plot PDF and CDF for Capital Bikeshare trip duration under 60 minutes for both type of user- Member and Casual.\nRandom Variable\nA random variable is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon in a sample space. For example, if we roll two fair dice at a time the probability of having a sum of 2 {P(X=2)} is 1/36 since it can only occur when there is 1 on both dices. Similarly the probability of having a sum of 6 {P(X=6)} is 5/36 since we can have a sum of 6 in the following events- {1,5}, {2,4}, {3,3}, {4,2}, {5,1} and the total number of possible events is 36.\nTypes of Random Variable\nThere are two types of random variable-\ni) Discrete Random Variable\nDiscrete Random Variables can have a finite number of distinct values. For example, the number of students present in a class, the number obtained from a dice throw, etc. The probability function for Discrete Random Variable is PMF (Probability Mass Function).\nii) Continuous Random Variable\nContinuous Random Variables can take on an infinite number of values such as the weight of the students in class room. The probability function for continuous random variable is PDF.\nProbability Distributions\nProbabilities assigned to various outcomes in the sample space S, in turn, determine probabilities associated with the values of any particular random variable defined on S.\nProbability Mass Function (PMF) is used for discrete random variables and it describes how the total probability is distributed among all the possible range values of the Random Variable X. For example, the probability mass function of rolling a dice is as follows-\n\n\n\nx\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\np(x)\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n1/6\n\n\n\nProbability Density Function (PDF) is used for continuous random variables and it defines the probability function representing the density of a continuous random variable lying between a specific range of values. PDF satisfies the following-\ni. f(x) \\(\\geq\\) 0, for all x \\(\\epsilon\\) R\nii. f is piecewise continuous\niii. \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\) f(x) = 1\nFor a given limit of a to b, the PDF of a continuous random variable will be, \\[P(a\\leq x \\leq b)= \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx\\]\nCumulative Density Function (CDF)\nThe Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), of a real-valued random variable X, evaluated at x, is the probability function that X will take a value less than or equal to x. It is used to describe the probability distribution of random variables. The properties of a CDF is-\n\nEvery CDF \\(F_x\\) is non decreasing and right continuous \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} F_x(x) = 0\\) and \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} F_x(x) = 1\\)\nFor all real numbers a and b with continuous random variable X, then the function fx is equal to the derivative of \\(F_x\\), such that \\[F_x(b) - F_x(a)= P(a&lt;X\\leq b)= \\int_{a}^{b} f_x(x) dx\\]\n\nRelationship between PDF and CDF for a Continuous Random Variable\nLet X be a continuous random variable with pdf f and cdf F.\ni. We can find the CDF by integrating the PDF-\n\\[\nF_x(x)= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx\n\\]\nii. We can find the PDF by differentiating the CDF-\n\\[f(x)= \\frac{d}{dx} F_x(x)\\]\nExample of PDF and CDF\nFollowing is an example of PDF and CDF of Capital Bikeshare trip duration under 60 minutes for all bikeshare trips at May 2019.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nCabi= pd.read_csv(r'D:\\VT Class Resourse\\2-1\\Machine Learning\\Data for Blog\\201905-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.csv')\nCabi['Duration (minutes)']=Cabi['Duration']/60\ncounts, bin_edges = np.histogram(Cabi['Duration (minutes)'], bins=10,\n                                 density = True)\npdf = counts/(sum(counts))\ncdf = np.cumsum(pdf)\nplt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf, label= 'PDF');\nplt.plot(bin_edges[1:], cdf, label= 'CDF')\nplt.legend()\n\n&lt;matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x1a583e4ab50&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing is the PDF and CDF of bikeshare trip duration by Casual user and Regular members-\n\nCasual= Cabi[Cabi['Member type'] == 'Casual']\nMember= Cabi[Cabi['Member type'] == 'Member']\nC_counts, C_bin_edges = np.histogram(Casual['Duration (minutes)'], bins=10,\n                                 density = True)\nC_pdf = C_counts/(sum(C_counts))\nC_cdf = np.cumsum(C_pdf)\nplt.plot(C_bin_edges[1:],C_pdf,label= 'Casual User PDF');\nplt.plot(C_bin_edges[1:], C_cdf,label= 'Casual User CDF')\n\nM_counts, M_bin_edges = np.histogram(Member['Duration (minutes)'], bins=10,\n                                 density = True)\nM_pdf = M_counts/(sum(M_counts))\nM_cdf = np.cumsum(M_pdf)\nplt.plot(M_bin_edges[1:],M_pdf,label= 'Member PDF');\nplt.plot(M_bin_edges[1:], M_cdf,label= 'Member CDF')\nplt.legend()\n\n&lt;matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x1a583e96d10&gt;"
